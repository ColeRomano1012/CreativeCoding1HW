For my final project I made a game where a ship(triangle) can shoot at asteroids(circles) and can be reset after all the asteroids
have been destroyed. The controls include the arrows to move the ship around and space bar to shoot at the randomly moving rocks.
First I created the canvas and coded for the ship. i then coded the lasers and asteroids. my orignal plan was to make the asteroids with 
hectagons for a more rocky texture but decided to stick with grey circles. I researched how to have each rock split into two when hit. 
i then customized the color of the canvas for a cosmic vibe. Some issues I ran into was the movement of the rocks and the seamless movement
of the ship. Overall, the main objectives were successfully coded.
