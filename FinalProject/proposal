For my final project, I will be creating a retro style simple video game. I will be adding a narrative in outerspace. A space ship will have to navigate to a planet evading 
asteroids. using barriers and collisions. 

Some work that inspired this idea is arcade games like pacman and asteroids, also games like snake and time pilot. These old classic arcade games are very simple and I 
think their simplicity is what makes them adored, along with nostaliga. 

The main techniques I will have to learn more is collisions and barriers. I will also need to learn more about customizing the appearance of the game with imaging tools.

So far I have completed the reasearch to do any extra techniques not covered in class, I have a good idea where my final project is headed. Before the weekened I plan to complete 
and add any necessary or basic coding, including the barriers and collisions, and transversal traits with keys. Over the weekened I plan to finish with any customizations or
appearnace/colors of my picture. Adding to the readme file as I work along.
