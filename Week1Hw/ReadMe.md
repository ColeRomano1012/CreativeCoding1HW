CLI is Command Line Interface and is text based. Command line interface allows users to execute comands by typing keywords and parameters into a terminal.
CLI requires users to know specific commands and code. 
GUI is Graphical User Interface. Graphical user interface uses graphical elements like icons, buttons, windows, and menus to allow users to interact with a system. 
Graphical user interface is more user friendly than CLI as it uses graphics for interaction rather than specific lines of commands.A disadvantage of GUI is that is takes up more memory.
Command line interface lacks User friendliness but allows for more control and is more efficient.
Command line interface can be intimidating for beginner users but those who know the correct commands and syntax can work much more efficient and faster than with GUI.
CLI has no graphics and a big disadvantage to command line interface is spelling. If spelling mistakes are made, the commands given will not be received by the progam.
This is a big result in why command line interface is not user friendly as people who do not know commands will be susceptible to spelling mistakes.
A keyboard and mouse is required for graphical user interface while only a keyboard is needed for command line interface.
