This lecture made me end up feeling really optimistic. Over the Lecture Randy Pausch talks about his list of dreams.
One of Randy's Dreams I relate to the most is his dream to play in the NFL. I had a similar dream when I was young in grade school with the MLB.
I dreamed to play with the Orioles. Even though this dream slowly died as I got older in school, it still lead to many life lessons like the ones Randy learned. 
The lessons learned in baseball and other sports can be used in life after school. 
Not only did I learn many lessons but I made lifelong friendships that are strong even while in college. 
The lecture makes me reflect on the dream I currently have and is a reminder to keep dreaming and get past the brick walls.
